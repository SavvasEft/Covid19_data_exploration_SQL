This is an SQL project to demonstrate some of my skills in Standard SQL.

The project explores data from Covid-19, through queries.

Skills:
Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Converting Data Types

Data:
The data used was taken from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. We explore data between 01/01/2020 - 10/01/2022 (dd/mm/yy).
The data was first edited in excel, and broken into two .csv files, with four common columns: 'iso_code', 'continent', 'location', 'date'.

The data was uploaded in Google BigQuery, where the queries were run.
